            <img src="assests/images/profile pic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Crystal Roper">

            <p>Hello world! My name is Crystal, and I am brand new to the wonderful world of programming. I began my
                professional career at the ripe age of 18 when I landed a job as an intern at a medical billing
                company. Fast forward 11 years and I am still in the medical billing industry, but got quite the taste
                of technology along the way.</p>

            <p>The healthcare industry has a larger technology component than the average person may expect.
                From the initial encounter at the hospital or doctor's office, to the payment made by the insurance
                companies,
                there is an imense amount of information that needs to be tracked, organized, and exchanged
                electronically.
                Many companies offer proprietary software as a service so that hospitals, doctors offices, and other
                facilities can quickly and efficiently bill for services. Working at one of these companies is where I
                got a small
                glimpse into the programming required to create such impressive and complex software. This exposure,
                combined with my lifelong appreciation of logic and structure, led to my enrollment in the CWRU
                Bootcamp. I'm excited to see where this new chapter in my career will take me!</p>

            <p> Random facts about me:

                <ul>
                    <li>I have two wonderful, adorable puppies - Buttercup & Leia. Both named after Princesses; both
                        extremely
                        spoiled, as befitting their title.</li>
                    <li>My absolute favorite color is BLUE!</li>
                    <li>Hobbies include: videogames, sewing, reading, napping.</li>
                </ul>
